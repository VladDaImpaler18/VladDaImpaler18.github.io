What does coding, campfires, and **cute** puppies have in common? Normally nothing, but for me this project involved all three.

#### Coding
This project involved using Sinatra and ActiveRecord to create a website with RESTful logic, and a Model, View, Controller structure. It was time consuming, laborous, and *a whole lot of fun.* I started things by mapping out the route that each link could take you to. Figuring out what I wanted users to be able to do, what they shouldn't be able to do, and how to make it practical. During my coding sessions I kept coming up with cool ideas, something to try, see if it works and *that* is the reason why I think this is my best work.
It includes a CLI, which was our first project, it includes complex relations and includes pictures of my cute puppy! I think one of the challanges to this was the time put into it, and making it work with the responsiblities I recently adopted, and life. 

#### Cute Puppies!
I had recently adopted a cute puppy, which we named Mako, and his sister Luna, who was adopted by our housemate. These puppies have been given the title of "the world's best time wasters". Having a puppy takes a lot of work, and a bit of a life adjustment. No longer could I follow my own schedule when something so small and cute depends on me and takes attention on demand, my work time was hit and I fell behind. This project was time consuming and took me to the last week but I refused to cut corners or just make a project to  achieve the minimum. This project is art, and i'm proud of this achievement. I've learned so much and it shows in my work. I dedicate this project to Mako, my cute puppy who is the best time waster, a professional greeter and puts a smile to my face everytime I see his huge doggy smile and entire body wag when he sees me.

#### Campfires
How do campfires figure into this? Well being behind schedule I had to cut what little social activities I had to get work done on my project. I missed out on hiking adventures, rock climbing adventures, but I did decide to still go to our two traditional camping trips. During the day we camped and at night we sat around the camp fire. Me being a night owl I was always the last one up so, why not code in front of the camp fire. It was a picturesque moment, the cool night, warm fire and nothing but nature in the background--if you haven't experienced it I would recommend it. If you're reading this and decide to check out my project, I hope you enjoy playing around with it as I enjoyed making it.
