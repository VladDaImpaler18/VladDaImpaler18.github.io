Growing up, I have always been around computers. My Dad was one of the first people to get onboard with the home computer. When I started with computers, it was to simply play games. Eventually, I learned how to break computers, and learned very quickly how to fix it! Knowing how to break something really shows you how it works. 

When I was a kid, I took programming classes all through secondary school. Even though I was pretty good at it, I actually hated it. I think it was the pressure of having to "make it work" that I didn't like. It took some of the magic and fun out of programming.

Once graduating from high school, I went into other things like Engineering and Biology, all to avoid programming. These pathways taught me to look at the world in a different light. For example, my engineering classes taught me about mechanical force and opened my eyes to the way things work. I cannot see a bridge without thinking of the mechanical principles that hold the bridge aloft. 

Despite actively trying to avoid programming, I eventually worked my way back to it, like meeting up with a highschool sweetheart. Learning how to program and thinking logically changes the way you think and view the world. It is like a game that never gets old; it is constantly updating. It is a puzzle that never gets stale. Programming lets you see another logic to things. Athough I have found the downside to be that I cannot pass reCAPTCHA tests anymore; the computer thinks I am a robot.
