![What do I write about?](http://i.qkme.me/357ica.jpg)

And so this is it, the final entry in my journey during my time completing the Online Software Engineering at Flatiron. I came to Flatiron school with a Bachelors in Programming and Information Systems. I had a solid background in programming and the core fundamentals of it. I will admit that even with everything I've learned to get that Bachelors, all that I've practice, I was still unsure of myself. Could I? Should I? Will I even be able to? I don't think I can, it won't be good. I wasn't as prepared to get into the job market or even know how to market myself. I joined the Flatiron community and was curious to what would come of it. In all of my programming I never learned how to make an application communicate with the Internet directly, but with the very first module I made a National Park Service park finder command line interface application that would connect to the internet and fetch data through the NPS.gov api source! From hello world to hello world wide web, what an milestone achievement! Flatiron didn't just teach me surface layer how to code in a different language, it gave me a new way of thinking while I code. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) programming, style, readability, structure and most importantly **abstraction.**

### Maneuvering through code shouldn't be like navigating a maze.
Before Flatiron, I never even stopped to think about code architecture, readability, or separation of duties. I learned about **MVC** which is an abbreviation for Model View Controller. It is a design pattern for web applications that helps make code less insane to debug, maintain and read by splitting things in logical groups. Models interact with the database, Views present the data to the user, and Controllers are the middle man for the Model and View components and they handle actions with HTTP requests. Combined with RESTFul architecture and your web application design starts to make more structural sense. It will allow of a work by pieces approach that can allow multiple people working on different aspects of the application. These aren't coding hacks, they aren't neat programming tricks, knowing these design patterns make me more marketable, more useful for a business and a better programmer as whole.


### Hold the copypasta please.
Readability sounds pedantic, why as a coder does my code need to be readable? For your own sanity and for anyone else that may have to look through it for debugging or maintenance. Code that is readable has a rhythm and rhyme to it. It looks good, it's easily maneuverable and if done correctly it can be altered or added to with relative ease. The motto is DRY, like i said earlier, Don't Repeat Yourself! ;) Making clean, clear code makes it more enjoyable for me to program because I don't have copypasta of the same blocks of code everywhere. If I ever need to refresh to myself what this portion of code does it's easily translatable. 

### I ${verb}, you ${verb}, we all ${verb} for ${noun}
The most important aspect for me, one of the biggest takeaways I've learned from Flatiron is the power of abstraction. Writing specific code, a 1-case use function is acceptable but being able to write code that can bend and flow turns the code into a "living" thing, able to adjust itself to meet the criteria. You can immediately see the payoff when using the React framework. With react components can present the data you need for multiple scenarios. Being that everything is built from building blocks React provides amazing responsiveness and a flow of information that makes sense. I didn't realize until I started learning React that I have already started implementing that idea of components and building blocks into my code already. My Javascript project was very modular and had functions that would create labels, to create a form, for my Questions class. It is a lot of code to put here but, I encourage you to check out my project at it's Github repo [Data-Entry-Mod-4-Project](https://github.com/VladDaImpaler18/Data-Entry-Mod-4-Project).

Making things modular allows for almost a plug and play type of experience while coding. It is easy to find things that aren't working as expected because modules or *components* are structured by their role in the program.

So when asked "What I Learned in Flatiron School" I learned how to be an artist as well as a coder. I have proof of my abilities and witnesses to my accomplishments. I have the skill, the know-how and the drive, and a portfolio of projects that mean something to me, and display my abilities in coding. For now on no more doubt. I can, and I will.
