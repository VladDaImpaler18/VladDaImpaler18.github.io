<p>After graduating from SUNY Farmingdale College with a degree in Computer programming and Information Systems, I began working for a company that did not make use of my programming abilities. Though I have grown professionally with Leutech, I am looking forward to expanding my abilities and moving on to a programming career with the help of Flatiron. Through this blog, I hope to show growth in my coding abilities.</p>
